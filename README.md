# lrd - Lexical Response Data

## Overview

The *lrd* package provides tools for quickly and accurately processing the large amounts of lexical response data that are typically generated from cued-recall tests, while also being able to control for minor errors in participant responses.

## To install lrd:

    1: Install devtools if you do not have it. install.packages(devtools)

    2: With devtools installed, you can then install domo by executing the following:
	   devtools::install_github("npm27/lrd")

    3: Load the library to get started! library(lrd)

## Scoring data:

This package uses two functions for scoring data.

	1: percent_match()
	
	2: score_recall()

Detailed descriptions of each function are available in the documentation and in the [manuscript](https://osf.io/g96a7/)


You can also use the [Shiny app](https://npm27.shinyapps.io/lrdshiny/)!
